### Challenges I had to look up
* day 6 part 2 (can't figure out the equation instead of simulating everything)
* day 9 part 2 (never really done a flooding problem before and this seems like a tricky one)


### Challenges that I spent a lot of effort solving on my own instead of looking them up like a sensible person
* day 8 part 2 (figuring out how to decode the scrambled 7-segment displays felt like a CTF)


### that that reminded me of CTF challenges
* day 8 part 2
* day 16


### Notes
* day 17 part 1: very broken physics leads to a funny plot for the correct trajectory
