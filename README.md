This is a repo that has my solutions for Advent of Code 2021 in Python 3.
There were 25 challenges and each challenge was split into two parts.
I solved about half of the challenges completely and I sovled the first part of a couple more.

### Notes
* day 17 part 1: very broken physics leads to a funny plot for the correct trajectory
* day 8 part 2 and day 16: felt like CTF puzzles
